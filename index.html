          Initially, beginners enjoy making buttons, adding the links, adding
          images, working with layout and a lot of cool stuff in web designing

          <li class="listcolor">Tribute Page to Albert Einstein</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Webpage Including Form</h3>
        <p>
          Forms are always an essential part of any project and you will be
          working with a lot of forms in most of the applications so why not
          practice it earlier and test your knowledge. Once you get familiar
          with the input field or basic tags in HTML to create a form make a
          project using all those tags. How to use a text field, checkbox, radio
          button, date, and other important elements in a single form. You will
          be learning how to give a proper structure to a webpage while creating
          a form. Knowledge of HTML/HTML5 is good enough but you can use a bit
          of CSS to make the project look better. Take help from the links given
          below.

        <h3>Parallax Website</h3>
        <p>
          A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that you
          can keep in place and you can scroll down the page to see different
          parts of the image. With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can give
          a parallax effect to a website. Using the parallax effect in web
          designing is really popular and it gives beautiful look and feels to
          the webpage. Give it a try and divide the whole page into three to
          four different sections. Set 3-4 background images, align the text for
          different sections, set margin and padding, add background-position
          and other CSS elements and properties to create a parallax effect. You
          can take help from Parallax Website.
